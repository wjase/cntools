CNTOOLS - achieve more with less code

CNTOOLS was created to help in the Development of JoeyMail.net and the associated
kids Webstart Application.

It includes libraries for:
  SVG
  Animation - including animated SVG characters
  Resource Loading (from anywhere including within Webstart Apps)
  Screen stacks and UI (like mobile interfaces but in Swing)
  Declarative events
  Sprites
  Sounds
  and much more.

It includes a bunch of handy classes for stream processing and doing things
that you would be writing repeated chunks of code for.

It is evolving as I write the application that uses it.
Whenever I find myself copying a common bit of code, I abstract it out and make 
it a utility class.

I hope you find some or all of it useful.

Enjoy!
